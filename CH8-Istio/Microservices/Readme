user=>catalog=>product

For istio chapter we are going to use a simple commerical application which consist of 3 microservices.
1. user: this microservice is for user validation, it calls microservices catalog if user authenticates
2. catalog: this microservice calls product microservice to get list of products available for this user.
3. product: this microservice gives list of products available for particular user.

Dockerfile has been provided for each microservice in its directory, use it to create images and upload it on private registry
of IBM Cloud Private, before trying exercises given in the book.
